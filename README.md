Mirogrid is a small scale power supply integrating multi-power gernerator and multi-load demand! The renewable energy like solar power and wind power are optional and free in a microgrid. The storage system can be used in microgrid to store and release power. The load demand can be studied from the real user behavior. 
Nowadays, mutlti-renewable source and advaneced power storage are largely imporved. However, there is little real case in the power and energy management system, most of the research is only in the simulation layer and fragmented. Thus, in a microgrid, a comprehensive power and energy management system is necessary.  Especially, it is of vital importance to build a modular management software can be applied in different microgrid.
By the way, the management software should integrate advanced controller and microgrid optimization in two axis: microgrid simulaiton, real microgrid management! 
The AI can be used to improve the power efficency and ancillary service.
